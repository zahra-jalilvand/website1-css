        <p class="para1">A crime is a deliberate act that causes physical or psychological harm, damage to or loss of property, and is against the law.</p>
        <h3 class="heading">Crime As Social Problem</h3>
        <p class="para">Some of us have been directly affected by crime. Many others because we are fearful of it, have been directly victimized by crime. </p>
         <p class="para"> We therefore routinely process such knowledge, and take defensive action accordingly.</p>
        <p class="para"> Crimes put heavy pressure on federal, state and household budgets.</p>
            <p class="para">Crime is regarded by the public as one of the leading social problems today.</p>
